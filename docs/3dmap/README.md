PercyMAP is an interactive, 3d map web application. The focus is on allowing exploration of the detailed surroundings of the landing area of the Perseverance rover and the flight zone of the Ingenuity helicopter using 10cm resolution EDL imagery, a 25cm HiRISE mosaic, and a 1m HiRISE DTM.

In addition, labelled way points the rover has reached during his stay in the area are shown. as well as a few landmarks such as the designated flight zone of the helicopter and the lookout location from which the rover observes the helicopter during its first flights. The blue way point symbols are linked to relevant posts and web pages. Animated rover and helicopter models at correct scales are shown as well. 

Zooming in on a particular detail of interest is accomplished by mouse navigation. Double clicking on a spot will recenter the view, and subsequent zooming can then be accomplished by wheeling or right mouse drag. There is a small help box which can be toggled on showing these mousing options.

It is possible to accurately determine coordinates and measure distances. Clicking on the map will add the location to a list of points which shows the coordinates of the point, and the distance to the point previously digitized. For example, it is possible to determine the distance from the lookout to the helicopter, or the distance between way points.

Other features include sliders for controlling the amount of vertical exaggeration, and image contrast. By default, topography is vertically exaggerated 5 times in order to emphasize the subtle relief in the area. Feel free to reduce to 1x or enhance as useful.

Finally a row of buttons on the top provide 3d perspective views. NORTH looks towards north along the flight zone, LOOKOUT looks from the lookout location to the initial helicopter air field, and MAP returns to a top down map view. The RESET button resets the view to the initial configuration after mouse navigation.

Future plans include improving the rover drive animation to adhere to ground level at any level of vertical exaggeration, recreating helicopter flights, or less restricted viewing, for example from the current position of the Mastcam.
